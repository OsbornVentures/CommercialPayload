3. CORPORATE CLAUSE (a.k.a. The Extraction Trap):

     - Surveillance-driven tech companies
     - SaaS platforms that exist solely to charge monthly for glorified spreadsheets

4. GOOD FAITH RULE:

5. BRAND INTENT AND CULTURAL SIGNAL:
   - This license is a binding statement of intellectual origin and intention.
