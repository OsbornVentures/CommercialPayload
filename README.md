> 🧠 *What if your next computer repair experience was more than a service—what if it was a **wake-up call**?*

**Bits N Bytes Inc.** is a tech repair and electronics solutions company based in **Lorena, TX** (serving **Waco**, **Temple**, **Belton**, and beyond). This script isn't just a toy—it’s a symbolic broadcast. A **payload of truth** wrapped in ANSI and progress bars.

## 🎯 What This Is

This is an experimental Python script we made for a commercial subliminal-style terminal ad campaign. Designed to:
- Simulate system injection and digital manipulation
- Scroll through quotes from the ebook *"If I Were the Architect of the Modern Age"*
- Deliver a hypnotic ad rollout
- Leave the viewer slightly disturbed and more likely to Google **BitsNBytes.ai**
- We never deployed the commercial, But the idea was cool right?
